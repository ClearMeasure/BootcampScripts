# BootcampScripts
Scripts for automating the setting up a Bootcamp build/application server

These scripts are used in the Automated Bootcamp scripts for provisioning the software and settings on the VM used for building and running bootcamp.  The main file is `Initialize-BuildVM.ps1`, which does initialization and calls all the others.
